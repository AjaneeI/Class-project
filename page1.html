        <h5>This picnic will be hosted in Jamaica Plain. The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University stewards one of the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and best documented collections of temperate woody plants, with particular focus on the floras of eastern North America and eastern Asia. Our adventure will include a beautiful walk on a trail leading to a stunning, secluded field with beautiful tall trees that provide shade. Everyone will have their hand in making sure that this event goes smoothly so I can't wait to see what we all come together with for this potluck!</h5>
